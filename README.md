# RUST ALGOTRADER
A decently performant algorithmic trading system for crypto exchanges, built from the ground up as a personal project to help me and my friend explore the space. This project is a demonstration version of a private project and has had content redacted. It makes no claim to completeness, requiring fleshed-out API connections, stability fixes, account behaviors, documentation, and organization/scaffolding.
### Use at your own risk.
The implementation of insightful analysis and profitable strategies is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Quickstart (for Binance testnet)
1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Make Binance testnet or live account
3. Make a real environment file from either shell/batch sample and exclude it in .gitignore
4. Populate env file with API keys
5. Run either `.env.bat` or `source .env.sh`
6. Run `cargo run --release`

Further info can be found in directory readme's.
