# RUST ALGOTRADER
A decently performant algorithmic trading system for crypto exchanges, built from the ground up as a personal project to help me and my friend explore fintech and learn Rust. This project is a demonstration version of a private endeavour and has had content redacted.
The implementation of insightful analysis and profitable strategies is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Quickstart (for Binance testnet)
1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Make Binance testnet or live account
3. Make a real environment file from either shell/batch sample and exclude it in .gitignore
4. Populate env file with API keys
5. Run either `.env.bat` or `source .env.sh`
6. Run `cargo run --release`

Further info can be found in directory readme's.


### DISCLAIMER
I have no professional experience in algotrading, and am entirely self taught. This project is incomplete, relatively untested, and contains unresolved bugs. I offer no assurance that the tools and systems I have developed are up to any known standard or in line with any obvious convenience.
